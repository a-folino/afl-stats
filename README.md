# AFL Stats

Web app I made that displays data from the 2022 AFL season. Built for functionality, only very basic styles have been applied.

Displays teams, games of each team, games by round and league standings.

### `npm install`

Installs dependencies for app to run.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
